# ㅤقalc
ㅤقalc (or Qalc for the places where I don't have unicode) is short for Quran Calcultor, and is a program to calculate a decently accurate estimate for the percentage of Quran you have memorised. It uses a word by word bases rather than verse, which rewards accordingly whether a long verse or short verse has been memorised (in terms of percentage, but of course there is more reward that a program can not show...)
**This program gives an apporximate estimate, as the total word count was difficult to determine due to the nature of the Arabic language**
This program was created by AI, for me a means to get pen to paper as someone with horrendous knowledge on programming, because it is after all just a series of algorithms (yet another thing from the Islamic world!)

# Usage
- begin by downloading qc.py and saving it to a directory of your choice
- ensure python3 is installed however you see fit (I am familliar with, so like to use the scoop package manager on windows)
- open you terminal
- change directory by typing the `cd` command in your terminal, e.g. `cd C:/Users/me/Documents`
- now run the command `python qc.py` (which tells python to run the program)
- now you can input the verses you know in the standard format of `1:1-7` (first chapter, verse 1 to 7) and repeat this for any range of verses, seperate the ranges with a comma, not a space like so: `1:1-7,114:1-6,112:1-3` etc.
- hit enter to have your result, small percentage? Don't be disheartened keep on working hard, everyone was there at one point! Large percentage? Well done, keep going!

To any programmers reading the code, sorry!
